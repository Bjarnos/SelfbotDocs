## Collaborate
Wish to collaborate with me on the project? My contacts are at [https://bjarnos.dev](https://bjarnos.dev)!

## Soon
Things coming soon:
- ProfileService (done, requires docs)
- DataService
- MessageService.get_message_by_id()
- Token refresh
- Multiple page support

{: .note }
It is highly recommended that you begin with reading [BotService](/docs/Services/BotService), from there you will be redirected further through the documentation. Happy developing!
